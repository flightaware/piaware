=== Upgrade Raspberry Pi software to the latest ===
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get upgrade
 sudo rpi-update
If rpi-update reported that it downloaded firmware and said you need to reboot for it to take effect, reboot:
 sudo reboot

=== Obtain, build and install the RTL-SDR libraries ===
This is the software that can talk to the software defined radio in the RTL-SDR dongle...
 sudo apt-get install git git-core cmake libusb-1.0-0-dev build-essential
 mkdir src
 cd src
 git clone git://git.osmocom.org/rtl-sdr.git
 cd rtl-sdr
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake ../ -DINSTALL_UDEV_RULES=ON
 make
 sudo make install
 sudo ldconfig
 sudo cp rtl-sdr.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
Keep the system from thinking that the RTL-SDR dongle is for watching TV...
cat <<EOF >/tmp/no-rtl.conf
 blacklist dvb_usb_rtl28xxu
 blacklist rtl2832
 blacklist rtl2830
 EOF
 sudo mv /tmp/no-rtl.conf /etc/modprobe.d/

 sudo reboot

=== Obtain, build and install dump1090 ===
This is for the FlightAware version.  The main difference is that the FA version of dump1090 can emit "FlightAware" format directly, avoiding piaware having to run the faup1090 translation program.  Other than that it's the same as dump1090 from Malcolm Robb.  Anyway...
